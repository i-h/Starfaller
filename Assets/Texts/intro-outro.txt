You’re a Comet!

Minding your own comet business, falling through the vast universe, looking fierce, searching for the right elementals to feed from - and trying to avoid the wrong ones that will extinguish your flame! 

Nothing can stop you! Aside a lot of the bad elements! So essentially quite a lot of things can stop you…

Feeding from the good elementals will make you faster, though… so be careful! It’s going to be a tricky ride.

Oh no…

You hit those bad elements, didn’t you?

It’s okay. It’s not easy to be a Comet.

Try again?
